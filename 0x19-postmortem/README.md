#Issue Summary:
On July 10, 2023, between 8:00 PM and 10:00 PM EST, users experienced a service disruption on our e-commerce website, resulting in a 30% drop in website traffic during the outage. The root cause of the issue was identified as a database server failure.

Timeline:

8:00 PM EST: The issue was detected when our monitoring alert system received an alert for high database latency.
8:05 PM EST: Engineers investigated the issue and assumed it was due to a high load on the database server. They started optimizing database queries and increased the number of connections to the database.
8:30 PM EST: The latency issue persisted, and engineers realized that the root cause was a database server failure. They started investigating the server logs to identify the issue.
9:00 PM EST: The investigation revealed that the database server's disk had reached its capacity limit, causing it to crash. The team immediately escalated the issue to the database team.
9:30 PM EST: The database team replaced the disk and restored the database from a recent backup.
10:00 PM EST: The website service was restored, and the issue was resolved.
Root Cause and Resolution:
The root cause of the issue was a disk capacity limit that caused the database server to crash. The database team resolved the issue by replacing the disk and restoring the database from a recent backup.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar issues in the future, we will implement the following corrective and preventative measures:

Increase the database server's disk capacity to ensure it can handle future growth in data.
Implement monitoring to alert the team when the disk capacity reaches a certain threshold.
Establish a process for regular database backups to ensure we can quickly restore the database in case of a failure.
In conclusion, we apologize for the inconvenience caused to our users during the service disruption. We take this issue seriously and will take all necessary steps to prevent similar issues in the future. Our team is committed to providing the best service possible, and we appreciate your patience and understanding.
